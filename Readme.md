## üìå Overview

**Visual Market News** or  **NewsBiz** is an AI-powered market intelligence tool that turns the overwhelming chaos of financial news into clear, actionable insights.

Rather than sifting through walls of articles, our tool helps you understand the market‚Äôs emotional tone, key events, and relevant stocks ‚Äî in just a glance.

This project combines **MongoDB Vector Search**, **Google Gemini**, and **custom emotional/impact scoring** to deliver rich visual summaries and powerful search capabilities.

## üß© How It Works

> _Below you'll find architecture diagrams of vector search, embeddings, and RAG-based querying with MongoDB and Gemini._  
> _Also included: example MongoDB document structures._

### üîç Search System Flow (Diagram Included)
1. News articles are ingested daily.
2. Each article is:
   - Embedded as a semantic vector.![alt text](m7ib8yi82s1fknh4r-image2.avif)
   - Stored in MongoDB with tone/impact scores.
   ![alt text](<Group 7.png>)
3. When users search:
   - Queries are embedded.
   - Relevant documents are retrieved using **MongoDB Vector Search**.![alt text](0_kotBJOGl4287dFct.png)
   - If it's a question (ends in `?`), a **RAG** flow is triggered using Gemini to generate a precise, contextual answer. ![alt text](<rag syaster in project.png>)

`cd backend
npm install 
cd ../frontend
npm install`

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both `backend/` and `frontend/` (if needed):

**Backend `.env` file:**

env


`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key
